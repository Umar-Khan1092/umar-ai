# Real-Time Accident Detection System

## Overview
An AI-powered computer vision system that detects and classifies traffic accidents in real-time from video streams.

## Problem
Manual monitoring of traffic footage is slow and inefficient, often delaying emergency response.

## Solution
Built a deep learning-based system using YOLO and OpenCV to automatically detect accidents and trigger alerts in real time.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- YOLO  
- OpenCV  
- Deep Learning  

## Key Features
- Real-time video processing  
- Accurate accident classification  
- Scalable system architecture  

## Results & Impact
- Reduced manual monitoring  
- Faster incident detection  
- Improved traffic safety insights
